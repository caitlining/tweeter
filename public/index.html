      <h3>SOME TWEETS</h3>
      <p>Nothing's coming to my mind. Hello. Well, uh, listen, uh, I really- Yeah, I guessed you're a sailor, aren't you, that's why you wear that life preserver. What's going on? Where have you been all week?</p>
      <p>Uh, well, okay Biff, uh, I'll finish that on up tonight and I'll bring it over first thing tomorrow morning. Does your mom know about tomorrow night? Doc, she's beautiful. She's crazy about me. Look at this, look what she wrote me, Doc. That says it all. Doc, you're my only hope. Who are you? Hey man, the dance is over. Unless you know someone else who could play the guitar.</p>
